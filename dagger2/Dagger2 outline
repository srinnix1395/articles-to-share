- Explain the meanings of each annotation:
  + @Inject
  + @Component
  + @Module
  + @Scope
  + @Qualifier
  + @Provide
- What kind of injection: constructor injection, fields injection...
- Scope in dagger2

2. Part 2
- Global singleton and Local singleton
- Singleton has implicit dependency
- Singleton creation
  + file Module
  + file Component
- Dependency component vs sub-component

3. Part 3
- How to implement this by yourself without using dagger2.
- FAQ about what's errors that users can encounter
  + access visibility
- How to add dagger2 to android project? Explain each lines in gradle.


- Note:
  + Since Dagger 2 is operated with the code generation but not with the reflection you always have to set concrete types (no abstractions or generics)!
