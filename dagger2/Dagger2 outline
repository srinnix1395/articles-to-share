1. Part 1 - Các khái niệm cơ bản
- What is Dependency?
- Disadvantage of hard dependency:
  + Hard dependencies reduce the reusability
  + Hard dependencies make it hard for testing
  + Hard dependencies hinders code maintainability when the project scales up
- What is IoC?
- What is DIP?
- What is DI?
- What kind of injection:
  + Constructor injection
  + Fields injection: must not be "private"
  + Method injection

2. Part 2 - Into the Dagger 2
- Dagger 2
  > Dagger 2 is a library which helps the developer to implement a pattern of Dependency Injection (one specific form of Inversion of control).
  + Compare with Dagger 1
  + Explain the meanings of each annotation:
    . @Component
    . @Inject
    . @Module:
    . @Scope
    . @Qualifier
    . @Provide
- The first program with @Inject & @Compoment
- Global singleton and Local singleton
- Singleton has implicit dependency
- Singleton creation
  + file Module
  + file Component
- Dependency component vs sub-component

3. Part 3
- Scope in dagger2
- Handle scope in dagger 2

- Note:
  + Since Dagger 2 is operated with the code generation but not with the reflection you always have to set concrete types (no abstractions or generics)!
  + Dagger 1 uses Java reflection to achieve DI, therefore it's slow and it used to perform dependency resolution at RUNTIME
  + Dagger 2 uses Generating code to achieve DI, it used perform dependency resolution at COMPILE TIME
