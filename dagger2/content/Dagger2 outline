1. Part I - Basic principles
- What is Dependency?
- Disadvantage of hard dependency:
  + Hard dependencies reduce the reusability
  + Hard dependencies make it hard for testing
  + Hard dependencies hinders code maintainability when the project scales up
- What is IoC?
- What is DIP?
- What is DI?
- What kind of injection:
  + Constructor injection
  + Fields injection: must not be "private"
  + Method injection

2. Part II - Into the Dagger 2
- Dagger introduction, compare Dagger 1 and Dagger 2
- Dependency grapgh
- Dagger 2 annotation
  + @Component
  + @Inject
  + @Module:
  + @Scope
  + @Qualifier
  + @Provide
- The very first basic program with @Inject, @Compoment, @Module, @Provides, @Bind, @Qualifier
- Field injection

3. Part III - 1: The time of our dependencies
- @Scope

4. Part III - 2: The time of our dependencies
- Dependency component vs sub-component

5. Part IV - A new horizon
- Parts which series haven't covered
- Dagger annotation cheat sheet.

6. Part V - Hilt migration guide.
- annotation cheat sheet

#Note:
  - Since Dagger 2 is operated with the code generation but not with the reflection you always have to set concrete types (no abstractions or generics)!
  - Dagger 1 uses Java reflection to achieve DI, therefore it's slow and it used to perform dependency resolution at RUN-TIME
  - Dagger 2 uses Generating code to achieve DI, it used perform dependency resolution at COMPILE-TIME
